- **Terrain.rb**
  - **open_file**
   ```
    This method simply opens the file that has been passed to and stores the contents 
    in an array and will also grab the array size
  
    Working: Yes
    ```
  - **get_lowest_point**
    ```
    Assigns First element within the data array as the lowest point then searches for a smaller
    point within the array, o(n) time
    
    Working : Yes
    ```
  - **mean_height**
    ```
    Cycles through array adding all elements then divinding by number of elements
    
    Working: Yes
    ```
  - **deviation**
    ```
    Gets the standard deviation of all elemnts within file i.e how far each elevation within file is
    from the mean
   
    Working: Yes
    ```
- **Swimming_Pool.rb**
  - **initialize**
  ```
  Simply takes the passed parameters and assigns them to instance variables within swimming pool
  ```
  - **find_max_sizes**
    ```
   Cycles through data array and does a number of things at each data point
      1. If data point is along bottom row or right-most point in the data array
         assign its count (1), also if the current row/column+1 is out of bounds
         skip the next set of commands
      2. If column+1 and row+1 is the same elevation then get the min of both 
         those points' counts, add one to it and assign it to be the current
         indexs count
      3. If the bottom right most point of this potential square is not the same elevaton
         as the rest of it, then set the top left most points' count (1) i.e it's not
         a square anymore
  Potentially an o(n) algorithm, seeing as there's only three checks per point
  
  Working: Yes
   ```
  - **get_min_count**
   ```
   Finds the smaller count of row+1/column+1 and adds one to it, then assign current count
   as that, unless bottom right most point of this square isn't the same elevation
   
   Working: Yes
   ```
  - **print_pool_coords**
   ```
   Simply prints best potential pool position from TOP LEFT POINT IN SQUARE
   ```
- **Runner.rb**
  ```
  Simply issues all the commands that will run the entire programme. This is where the user inputs
  the name of the file that the programme works with
  
  Working: Yes
  ```
